# ANOVA Derivations

Power analysis is commonly applied during the experimental design phase.
Unfortunately, many R and Python packages only analyze normalized Cohen's
effect size (i.e., 0.1, 0.3, or 0.5). This makes it difficult to interpret the
impact of your effect size assumptions and test splits. These notebooks dissect
Cohen's effect sizes to analytically solve for MDE (minimal detectable effect)
and optimizing test splits.
